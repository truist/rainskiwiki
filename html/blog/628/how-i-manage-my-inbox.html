<h4>4 August 2012</h4>

<p>It turns out that other people don&#8217;t use email the same way I do. And it turns
out that some people think my email use patterns might have some useful ideas.
It also happens to be the case that I&#8217;m well-known for being good at keeping
track of things, and my inbox is basically the way I do that, so maybe
explaining my inbox will help people get better at keeping track of things. So
here it is <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>First rule: the only things in the inbox are things that are still underway,
in real life. Once something is done, the email gets deleted, archived, or
filed in a folder.</p>

<p>Second rule: only have a single inbox that receives messages that might result
in a to-do for you. Mail rules that filter email lists and such into folders
is fine - as long as that email list is passive-only. (And in the rare case
where something from the list generates a to-do, move that email to the
inbox.)</p>

<p>Third rule: the inbox has three statuses:</p>

<ol>
<li> New / unread - the things that you haven&#8217;t seen yet, or that you need to deal with in the short term (today or tomorrow, ideally). Example: an email from your mother with a question about her TV.</li>
<li> Flagged / starred - the things that you need to deal with in the longer term (3 days - a few weeks). Example: an email reminding you to blog about your inbox usage rules.</li>
<li> Read / not-flagged - things where someone else is responsible for taking the next step, but which you want to keep tracking. Example: a shipping notice from Amazon.com, for an item that hasn&#8217;t arrived yet.</li>
</ol>


<p>Fourth rule: <strong>everything</strong> that I have to keep track of (i.e. my to-do list)
goes into my inbox. I am constantly sending myself little one-line emails,
because that&#8217;s how I manage my to-do list.</p>

<p>Some secondary rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>If something sits in the &#8220;flagged / starred&#8221; category long enough, give up and archive/delete/file it.</li>
<li>Periodically review the entire inbox, cleaning out things that aren&#8217;t going to get done, and following up on things that have stalled.</li>
<li>The entire inbox (all three categories) should always be relatively short. I can gauge how overworked I am by whether my inbox has 5 things in it (ideal!) or 50 (WAY too many). I typically run at about 20. Looking at my (personal) inbox now, I have 6 unread, 8 starred, and 4 read.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some notes about how this works in Outlook / corporate email:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use flags for the long-term to-do items, and unread for the &#8220;new&#8221; status. I&#8217;ve tried setting flag reminder dates, or using different-color flags, and neither adds much value (for me) compared to the time spent managing them.</li>
<li>I delete most email once it&#8217;s handled, but I don&#8217;t have Outlook remove things from the Deleted folder until it&#8217;s a month old.</li>
<li>I keep all my sent mail. (Have it be locally archived if your company restricts mailbox size on the server.)</li>
<li>I keep a few key folders for explicitly filing things - but not many. It&#8217;s easier to search than it is to manually file and then try to guess where I filed something. It&#8217;s also very freeing to just accept that deleting email is OK.</li>
<li>I usually have a few project-specific folders under my Inbox, where I stash things I might need to reference later for a specific project. Once the project is done, I delete the folder.</li>
<li>I also keep a single &#8220;Save&#8221; folder that catches most things I think I might want to get back to someday, and then usually I have a few sub-folders for specific topics (like &#8220;sales&#8221; or &#8220;people&#8221;) - but I keep it to just a few folders.</li>
</ul>


<p>Some notes about how this works in Gmail:</p>

<ul>
<li>I use Gmail&#8217;s <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/email-overload-try-priority-inbox.html">priority inbox</a> because it is designed for me. It effectively (automatically) splits the &#8220;new&#8221; category into &#8220;email I need to see soon&#8221; and &#8220;everything else&#8221;, and then gives me a split view of my three categories, so the most urgent stuff is at the top, and the least urgent at the bottom. It&#8217;s perfect.</li>
<li>I archive every email, no matter how unimportant, once I&#8217;m done with it. No sorting or (manual) tagging - search is the answer here. And by archiving everything, I don&#8217;t have to pause and make a decision about whether to archive or delete. Sometimes I&#8217;ll forward an email to myself just to add keywords to it, so I can find it more easily later, but that&#8217;s it.</li>
<li>I do make use of Gmail&#8217;s automatic filters, to automatically tag emails. Most of that&#8217;s for shopping stuff (like Amazon) so I can spot it easily and mark it read (until the item arrives, when I archive it). Sometimes I&#8217;ll make a manual tag for temporary topic management (like &#8220;holiday planning&#8221;), but that&#8217;s rare.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://mattmc3.blogspot.com">mattmc3</a> says:</p>

<p>This is fascinating. I know you always ask me to send you an e-mail about
something or other, and have watched you e-mail yourself. I never could figure
that out, because I strongly dislike e-mail.</p>

<p>I get 100s of e-mails a day. Other than volume, the trouble I have with e-mail
is that search (in Outlook) stinks (s..l..o..w..), and reading messages to
filter through someone&#8217;s prose just to get action items is tedious. I only
want to do it one time and distill the info down to something that can go into
my &#8220;trusted system&#8221; (Paul Allen&#8217;s GTD philopophy). Appigo&#8217;s TODO iOS app is my
current TS.</p>

<p>My typical method of dealing with e-mail is to do a simple 4-bucket filter -
either an e-mail is sent directly to me by someone internal to my company,
something is sneeze mailed to me via a distro within my company, something is
sent to me by someone external to my company, or I&#8217;m cc:ed. From there, the
e-mails never leave those 4 &#8220;inboxes&#8221;. I read and respond to direct e-mails
within 24 hours. I usually do not respond to cc:ed e-mails as they are an FYI.
External stuff requires some on-the-fly decision making as to how to handle
it. And I try to just read the sneeze-mail stuff no more than twice a day.
Everything that I guess would take more than 5 minutes goes into TODO (synced
with toodledo.com, so I could input there as well). Anything under 5 minutes,
I get the ball back out of my court. Any e-mail chain longer than 5 messages
requires a meeting, and instead of replying I schedule it right there. I
occasionally need to sort/search an e-mail, but not often. Usually it&#8217;s to
forward something I already sent to prove I sent it to someone less organized.
I try to have no more than 10 todos assigned per day. This has cut way down on
my e-mail management, as there isn&#8217;t any. Filter automatically, and read
different buckets with different urgency. Important items get written in a
separate system.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d have any success with your method, but I&#8217;m glad it works for
you. Seems to have stuck with you for a long time, whereas I&#8217;ve had to adapt
mine again and again, but I think I&#8217;ve finally found a working system.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rainskit.com">Nathan Arthur</a> says:</p>

<p>Search in Outlook has been very fast for me - I&#8217;m using Outlook 2010, on an
SSD. Maybe the SSD makes a big difference? If I didn&#8217;t have the search, I
probably would have a different approach in Outlook. (Gmail, obviously, rocks
the search.)</p>

<p>I usually avoid &#8220;distilling&#8221; until I&#8217;m ready to actually do the work. Too
often, the requirements change by the time I get around to it <img src="../../smileys/smile.png" alt=":)" /> I just keep
the latest email in the thread (which is a pain in Outlook, but zero work in
Gmail).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen <em>David</em> Allen&#8217;s &#8220;GTD&#8221; stuff before, and I always thought it involved
too much active management of work items. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen <em>Paul</em>
Allen&#8217;s GTD stuff before. Is <a href="http://drhaswell.com/index.php/2010/05/getting-things-done-book-takeaway/">this</a> a reasonable overview of it? If so,
it&#8217;s almost <strong>exactly</strong> what I do, just via unread, starred, and folders,
instead of via some external tool. Email <em>is</em> the tool I use for managing my
to-do list; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m constantly emailing to-do items to myself.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t like the idea of moving stuff out of email and into some other
tool - that&#8217;s an extra step you have to take for every to-do.</p>

<p>Internal, external, or CC - those doesn&#8217;t consistently drive meaningful
response patterns for me. I don&#8217;t think it would do much good for me to
separate them out. (I already do separate out email lists.)</p>

<p>My system has evolved somewhat over time, but the only major difference was
that I stopped saving all email, a few years ago.</p>
