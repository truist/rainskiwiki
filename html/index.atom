&lt;h4&gt;12 February 2013&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I&#39;ll be giving up staying up late. (Starting tomorrow, the first day of
Lent.) For me, that means I&#39;ll be in bed by 11pm every night of Lent. This
year will be a &lt;em&gt;serious&lt;/em&gt; test of my self-discipline &lt;img src=&quot;http://magnetic-babysitter.local/./smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confused about why I&#39;m doing this? See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/tag/lent/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;25 October 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mattmc3.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;My friend&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattmc3.tumblr.com/post/7080355507/speaking-about-the-unspeakable-on-behalf-of-the-unheard&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mattmc3.tumblr.com/post/34302314350/10-questions-a-pro-choice-candidate-is-never-asked-by&quot;&gt;posted a link&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevinwax/2012/10/24/10-questions-a-pro-choice-candidate-is-never-asked-by-the-media/&quot;&gt;an article about
abortion&lt;/a&gt;. I find myself unable to avoid addressing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article poses 10 questions. Theoretically the article is complaining about
how the media doesn&#39;t ever ask pro-choice candidates about those questions,
but other than the paragraph at the top mentioning that complaint, the rest is
just the list of 10 questions. I don&#39;t much care whether the media asks those
questions (see: some future blog post), so I&#39;m not going to worry about
addressing that issue. Instead, I&#39;ll just reply with my own opinions about the
10 questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need to have read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/blog/610/on-abortion&quot;&gt;my previous post giving an overview of my
opinions&lt;/a&gt; if you want to understand my answers. I&#39;m not going to restate
those opinions here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. You say you support a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices in regards to abortion and contraception. Are there any restrictions you would approve of?&lt;/h4&gt;

	<title>How I manage my inbox</title>

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;4 August 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that other people don&#39;t use email the same way I do. And it turns
out that some people think my email use patterns might have some useful ideas.
It also happens to be the case that I&#39;m well-known for being good at keeping
track of things, and my inbox is basically the way I do that, so maybe
explaining my inbox will help people get better at keeping track of things. So
here it is &lt;img src=&quot;http://magnetic-babysitter.local/./smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First rule: the only things in the inbox are things that are still underway,
in real life. Once something is done, the email gets deleted, archived, or
filed in a folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second rule: only have a single inbox that receives messages that might result
in a to-do for you. Mail rules that filter email lists and such into folders
is fine - as long as that email list is passive-only. (And in the rare case
where something from the list generates a to-do, move that email to the
inbox.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third rule: the inbox has three statuses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; New / unread - the things that you haven&#39;t seen yet, or that you need to deal with in the short term (today or tomorrow, ideally). Example: an email from your mother with a question about her TV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Flagged / starred - the things that you need to deal with in the longer term (3 days - a few weeks). Example: an email reminding you to blog about your inbox usage rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Read / not-flagged - things where someone else is responsible for taking the next step, but which you want to keep tracking. Example: a shipping notice from Amazon.com, for an item that hasn&#39;t arrived yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fourth rule: &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; that I have to keep track of (i.e. my to-do list)
goes into my inbox. I am constantly sending myself little one-line emails,
because that&#39;s how I manage my to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some secondary rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something sits in the &quot;flagged / starred&quot; category long enough, give up and archive/delete/file it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodically review the entire inbox, cleaning out things that aren&#39;t going to get done, and following up on things that have stalled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The entire inbox (all three categories) should always be relatively short. I can gauge how overworked I am by whether my inbox has 5 things in it (ideal!) or 50 (WAY too many). I typically run at about 20. Looking at my (personal) inbox now, I have 6 unread, 8 starred, and 4 read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some notes about how this works in Outlook / corporate email:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use flags for the long-term to-do items, and unread for the &quot;new&quot; status. I&#39;ve tried setting flag reminder dates, or using different-color flags, and neither adds much value (for me) compared to the time spent managing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I delete most email once it&#39;s handled, but I don&#39;t have Outlook remove things from the Deleted folder until it&#39;s a month old.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep all my sent mail. (Have it be locally archived if your company restricts mailbox size on the server.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I keep a few key folders for explicitly filing things - but not many. It&#39;s easier to search than it is to manually file and then try to guess where I filed something. It&#39;s also very freeing to just accept that deleting email is OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I usually have a few project-specific folders under my Inbox, where I stash things I might need to reference later for a specific project. Once the project is done, I delete the folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also keep a single &quot;Save&quot; folder that catches most things I think I might want to get back to someday, and then usually I have a few sub-folders for specific topics (like &quot;sales&quot; or &quot;people&quot;) - but I keep it to just a few folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some notes about how this works in Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use Gmail&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/email-overload-try-priority-inbox.html&quot;&gt;priority inbox&lt;/a&gt; because it is designed for me. It effectively (automatically) splits the &quot;new&quot; category into &quot;email I need to see soon&quot; and &quot;everything else&quot;, and then gives me a split view of my three categories, so the most urgent stuff is at the top, and the least urgent at the bottom. It&#39;s perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I archive every email, no matter how unimportant, once I&#39;m done with it. No sorting or (manual) tagging - search is the answer here. And by archiving everything, I don&#39;t have to pause and make a decision about whether to archive or delete. Sometimes I&#39;ll forward an email to myself just to add keywords to it, so I can find it more easily later, but that&#39;s it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do make use of Gmail&#39;s automatic filters, to automatically tag emails. Most of that&#39;s for shopping stuff (like Amazon) so I can spot it easily and mark it read (until the item arrives, when I archive it). Sometimes I&#39;ll make a manual tag for temporary topic management (like &quot;holiday planning&quot;), but that&#39;s rare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;h5&gt;Comments&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mattmc3.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;mattmc3&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fascinating. I know you always ask me to send you an e-mail about
something or other, and have watched you e-mail yourself. I never could figure
that out, because I strongly dislike e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get 100s of e-mails a day. Other than volume, the trouble I have with e-mail
is that search (in Outlook) stinks (s..l..o..w..), and reading messages to
filter through someone&#39;s prose just to get action items is tedious. I only
want to do it one time and distill the info down to something that can go into
my &quot;trusted system&quot; (Paul Allen&#39;s GTD philopophy). Appigo&#39;s TODO iOS app is my
current TS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My typical method of dealing with e-mail is to do a simple 4-bucket filter -
either an e-mail is sent directly to me by someone internal to my company,
something is sneeze mailed to me via a distro within my company, something is
sent to me by someone external to my company, or I&#39;m cc:ed. From there, the
e-mails never leave those 4 &quot;inboxes&quot;. I read and respond to direct e-mails
within 24 hours. I usually do not respond to cc:ed e-mails as they are an FYI.
External stuff requires some on-the-fly decision making as to how to handle
it. And I try to just read the sneeze-mail stuff no more than twice a day.
Everything that I guess would take more than 5 minutes goes into TODO (synced
with toodledo.com, so I could input there as well). Anything under 5 minutes,
I get the ball back out of my court. Any e-mail chain longer than 5 messages
requires a meeting, and instead of replying I schedule it right there. I
occasionally need to sort/search an e-mail, but not often. Usually it&#39;s to
forward something I already sent to prove I sent it to someone less organized.
I try to have no more than 10 todos assigned per day. This has cut way down on
my e-mail management, as there isn&#39;t any. Filter automatically, and read
different buckets with different urgency. Important items get written in a
separate system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have any success with your method, but I&#39;m glad it works for
you. Seems to have stuck with you for a long time, whereas I&#39;ve had to adapt
mine again and again, but I think I&#39;ve finally found a working system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/blog/628/how-i-manage-my-inbox#c000950&quot;&gt;159 days ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com&quot;&gt;Nathan Arthur&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search in Outlook has been very fast for me - I&#39;m using Outlook 2010, on an
SSD. Maybe the SSD makes a big difference? If I didn&#39;t have the search, I
probably would have a different approach in Outlook. (Gmail, obviously, rocks
the search.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually avoid &quot;distilling&quot; until I&#39;m ready to actually do the work. Too
often, the requirements change by the time I get around to it &lt;img src=&quot;http://magnetic-babysitter.local/./smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt; I just keep
the latest email in the thread (which is a pain in Outlook, but zero work in
Gmail).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve seen &lt;em&gt;David&lt;/em&gt; Allen&#39;s &quot;GTD&quot; stuff before, and I always thought it involved
too much active management of work items. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen &lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt;
Allen&#39;s GTD stuff before. Is &lt;a href=&quot;http://drhaswell.com/index.php/2010/05/getting-things-done-book-takeaway/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; a reasonable overview of it? If so,
it&#39;s almost &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what I do, just via unread, starred, and folders,
instead of via some external tool. Email &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the tool I use for managing my
to-do list; that&#39;s why I&#39;m constantly emailing to-do items to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&#39;t like the idea of moving stuff out of email and into some other
tool - that&#39;s an extra step you have to take for every to-do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Internal, external, or CC - those doesn&#39;t consistently drive meaningful
response patterns for me. I don&#39;t think it would do much good for me to
separate them out. (I already do separate out email lists.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My system has evolved somewhat over time, but the only major difference was
that I stopped saving all email, a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;27 July 2012&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a MacBook Air that I used as my work (consulting) computer for 18
months or so. Then my new job gave me a Dell laptop that &lt;a href=&quot;https://plus.google.com/115702184162942442429/posts/HrRj16gEYJa&quot;&gt;feels seriously
inferior&lt;/a&gt;, but as with all things Windows/Dell, it is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yesterday I did something I&#39;ve done hundreds of times before with my Air,
but never before with my Dell: I closed the lid at the end of the day without
shutting things down first, stuffed it in my bag, and went home. (I was in a
hurry.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Air, that reliably sleeps the laptop, and I can always trust that
everything will be exactly as I left it when I reopen the lid, and the battery
won&#39;t have drained at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew not to trust the same thing on Windows, but I was in a hurry so I
decided to risk it, and maybe if it turned out well I&#39;d adjust my opinion
about Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what did I see when I opened it this morning? A boot-time message telling
me that the laptop had shut itself down because it was overheating, which
usually happens because it is in a tightly enclosed space with the fan vents
blocked. Like, say, a laptop bag. And by &quot;shut itself down&quot; they mean &quot;hard
power off, no saving your work&quot;. And they mean that they waited until the
battery was half drained to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I checked and I do have the laptop set to sleep when I close the lid. So
it should have just slept, and it shouldn&#39;t have been generating heat
(although I&#39;m not certain if the Windows sleep really does go that far), so it
shouldn&#39;t have had this problem. But it did. I&#39;m guessing the culprit is
Outlook, which often prevents rebooting because of third-party integrations
that aren&#39;t very well-done, so maybe it also prevented sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then of course, the culprit is Windows for actually listening to Outlook
and not putting the laptop to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Dell is really the savior here; faced with Windows not sleeping when
it was supposed to, Dell&#39;s choice was either to let the laptop overheat (and
break permanently), or build a feature to shut it off when it begins to. So,
thanks, Dell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But more than that, thanks to Apple for making devices where I just don&#39;t have
to worry about crap like this!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Comments&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/blog/624/apple-vs-dell-microsoft#c000947&quot;&gt;172 days ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mattmc3.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;mattmc3&lt;/a&gt; says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, right? The thought of ever going back just doesn&#39;t cross my mind. But,
as a counter-point, I did have the exact opposite problem today in fact. I
wanted my laptop to stay on while I updated the maps on my Garmin and the Mac
insisted it follow the energy settings which meant that the Garmin was 1/2
updated when the laptop force ejected it as part of its sleep routine. The
default behavior is certainly what you want 99% of the time, but for that 1% I
wish there was an easy way to say &quot;delay sleep&quot; for x minutes because I know
what I&#39;m doing and after that return to my prior settings automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/blog/624/apple-vs-dell-microsoft#c000948&quot;&gt;172 days ago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

	<content type="html" xml:lang="en">
	&lt;p&gt;Somewhere out there is a laptop bag just waiting for me to find it.  But first, I have to spec it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randsinrepose.com/&quot;&gt;Rands&lt;/a&gt;, I recently got &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/12/04/a_bag_of_holding.html&quot;&gt;laptop bag religion&lt;/a&gt; and I spent an excessive amount of time cogitating about features, price, tradeoffs, where to buy, and features again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I got serious about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t yet found the bag, but in the meantime, I&amp;#39;ve written this blog post, because it provided the excuse I needed to really &lt;del&gt;go batshit insane&lt;/del&gt; do a thorough job of my analysis.  Not only does this post include a detailed list of requirements for my perfect laptop bag, but it also includes a glance into what I do in my life as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainskit.com/blog/586/what-i-do&quot;&gt;Product Manager&lt;/a&gt;.  Hopefully one or the other of those is interesting enough to keep your attention &lt;img src=&quot;http://magnetic-babysitter.local/./smileys/smile.png&quot; alt=&quot;:)&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
